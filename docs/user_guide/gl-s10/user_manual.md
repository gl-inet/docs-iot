## General Product Introduction
### Product introduction
The GL-S10 is an IoT gateway device that supports BLE and Wi-Fi, providing a cost-effective solution for transmitting BLE broadcast data to the cloud. BLE supports GAP and GATT certification and can be used as either Master or Slave to connect and communicate with other BLE devices. GL-S10 can use Wi-Fi as a Station to connect to a parent route or can connect to the Internet through a WAN port. It has a built-in standard MQTT Client that can connect to any standard MQTT Servers to forward incoming BLE messages to the cloud server. 

The GL-S10 is ideally deployed in warehouses, shopping malls, airports, exhibition halls, tourist attractions and other scenarios for personnel management, asset management, environmental monitoring, indoor navigation, etc. 

### Product feature 
- Runs on Dual-core Xtensa® 32-bit LX6 microprocessor, supports BLE, Wi-Fi, and Ethernet

### BLE beacon
BLE Beacon is an optional accessory. User can purchase gateway kit with beacon for a quick Demo. The beacon can also be used for indoor positioning, asset management and other scenarios. The rotating base makes the device easy to disassemble; and the base has 3M adhesive which makes it easy to fix in place. 

After turning on the BLE switch at the bottom of the beacon, the beacon will broadcast BLE signals at an interval of 300ms. Select the filter function of GL-S10 and identify the devices by the BLE MAC address printed at the bottom of the beacon.

## MQTT Configuration
When the GL-S10 is connected to the MQTT server, you can also use the MQTT API to configure the GL-S10. 

You can configure MQTT using a third-party tool - MQTT X, downloadable from https://mqttx.app/. 

The default MQTT setting is configured to connect with the beta cloud platform. Enter the configuration for GL-S10 and MQTT X client to activate the connection. The beta cloud platform is for testing only and not for other usage. 

### Network Configuration
GL-S10 supports wired transmission and Wi-Fi for connecting to the router or gateway. The setting procedure can be found in section 3.6 Cable configuration and 3.7 Wi-Fi configuration. 

### MQTT X client configuration
Before doing the MQTT X client configuration, we need to configure the configuration of the MQTT server on S10 first. Find MQTT Server session in the S10 Tool APP.

Here we are using the test MQTT server: iot-s10-test.gl-inet.cn. And the Port is: 1884, so we need to set the Host in the following figure: iot-s10-test.gl-inet.cn. And set Port: 1884.

    </figure>
  </div>
</div>

On the windows version of the MQTT X client, start the MQTT X software and add a new connection. To configure the beta cloud platform, enter the URL address iot-s10-test.gl-inet.cn and port 1884. Click the upper right corner of the page to connect. A successful connection is shown below in Figure 33.

### MQTT Message Editing and Communicating with S10
The default command topic for this firmware is GL-IoT/comTopic/{dev_MAC}, and the command reply topic is GL-IoT/rspTopic/{dev_MAC}. 

The BLE MAC address of the GL-S10 device we use in this example is: E8DB841E2B1E (The BLE MAC address is printed on the bottom of the device or in the app). 

In our testing, MQTT X sends data via GL-IoT/comTopic/E8DB841E2B1E and receives data from GL-S10 by subscribing to GL-IoT/rspTopic/E8DB841E2B1E. 

Below is a demo of how to set data (SET_DEV_MESSAGE) and obtain data from GL-S10 (GET_DEV_MESSAGE):

**Step 1:**
Subscribe to the GL-IoT/rspTopic/E8DB841E2B1E topic using MQTT X.   
<center><img src="https://static.gl-inet.com/docs/en/3/setup/gl-s10/S10_Use_Manual_Pic/Pic36.png", width = 800></center>
<center>Figure 36</center>

**Step 2:**
SET_WIFI_CONFIG

API Function: Configure SSID and PWD of WIFI or SSID, user name, user password of WIFI WPA2, and try to connect to the corresponding route. 

{

"jsonrpc": "2.0",

"method": "SET_WIFI_CONFIG",

"params": {

"type":0,

"ssid": "Test",

"pwd": "123456"

},

"id": 1

}

Here we use "Test" for the SSID  and "123456" for the user passward.

- When type is equal to 0, SSID, PASSWORD can be set.
- When type is equal to 1, SSID, USERNAME, USERPASSWORD can be set.
- SSID: route name, length 0 - 32 characters.
- PWD: route password, length 0 - 64 characters.
- USERNAME: User name, length 0 - 32 characters.
- USERPWD: User password, length 0 - 64 characters.

Set data successfully:

**Step 3:**
GET_WIFI_CONFIG

API Function: Get the SSID and PWD of WIFI or SSID, user name, user password of WIFI WPA2\

{

"jsonrpc" :   "2.0" ,

"method" :   "GET_WIFI_CONFIG" ,

"params" :   {

"type" : 0

},

"id" :   2

}

- When type is equal to 0, get SSID, PASSWORD.
- When type is equal to 1, get SSID, USERNAME, USERPASSWORD

## BLE Data Uploading
After successfully establishing connection, GL-S10 automatically enters Scanning mode and scans for BLE signal during startup. If the MQTT server is connected, the BLE scan data will be packaged and uploaded to "GL-IoT/dataTopic/{dev_MAC}" topic in JSON format. ({dev_MAC} is the local BLE MAC address, in this example, the BLE MAC address of the GL-S10 device used is: E8DB841E2B1E). 

As shown above, the JSON fields have the following definitions

- MAC : Broadcast source address 
- rssi : Broadcast source signal strength 
- n : Broadcast source device name (this field will not appear if the broadcast source does not have a name) 
- ad : Broadcast data advData 
- ts : receive timestamp

If you purchased a gateway kit with a BLE Beacon and adds filtering rules for the beacon BLE MAC address according to section 3.9, the JSON information viewed here is the BLE information broadcast by the beacon. The beacons are placed at different distances from the GL-S10 gateway (distance up to the decimeter level), and the value of rssi (broadcast source signal strength) may fluctuate based on distance.
